Note: this app was made mainly for non mobile usage. 

I created this application to give me a better idea as to when herd immunity would be reached for each individual state. I'd seen a few projections as to when the United States will reach herd immunity but I'd argue that that is a useless statistic because it doesn't matter to someone in state X when state Y will do its part in reaching herd immunity for the whole country, if the state they live in has reached herd immunity then life will begin to go back to normal.

In the app, hovering over a state on the map will give the statistics of total vaccinations, population, percent of the population vaccinated, and projected herd immunity date for that state. The math behind the projected herd immunity date is explained in the Methods section of the app.

If at a later date there is more reliable data around reinfection I may go back and update the data analysis methods to improve the projections. As of right now, the projections don't seem to be unrealistic at all so I'm okay with how the math turned out.
